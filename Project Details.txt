OPEN Source .Net 5 Core C# Blazor Shopping Cart & E Commerce System

We have an existing open-source shopping cart application here:
https://github.com/stfbinc/EnterpriseCart/

This application is written in PHP MVC Style and Bootstrap. We want this existing application ported to use .Net Core 5 with Blazor Pages.

You would need to do the following:
- Create a .Net 5 Core Blazor Application Solution
- Replace every page in this Shopping Cart Application with a C# Blazor Page
- Port each individual page from PHP to C# Blazor
- All database / business logic calls should be made via the API

Pretty simple requirement, simply copy the existing working application and make it a Blazor Solution

The shopping cat uses the Enterprise Universal ERP API Here:
https://stfb.com/?page_id=1240

Enterprise Universal ERP API Documentation is here:
http://stfb.net/EnterpriseUniversalAPI/Documentation/auto/index.html

The point of this application is for us to give this away for free to our potential ERP API customers so they can learn how to use the API in a real-world application. This means that the code needs to simple, clean, and well documented.

This is an OPEN SOURCE Project, the results of the project will be licensed open source, and you agree to this when delivering any work.
